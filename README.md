# Polycast - Real-Time Language Learning Platform

A comprehensive language learning application that combines real-time transcription, translation, and spaced repetition flashcards with AI-powered content generation.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Flashcard Format Reference
**ALWAYS check this section when working on flashcards - the format is very specific!**

**FRONT of Card:**
1. English sentence with target word blanked out: "I will _____ into battle" 
2. Full translation with target word highlighted: "我将**冲锋**进入战斗"
3. "Click to reveal answer" hint

**BACK of Card:**
1. Full English sentence with target word highlighted: "I will **charge** into battle"
2. 🔊 Play Audio button for text-to-speech

**System Details:**
- Each word gets 5 sample sentences from Gemini with `~word~` markup
- SRS interval determines which sentence is shown (rotating through all 5)
- Cloze deletion format for active recall learning
- Target word highlighting in yellow on back, native language on front
- **CRITICAL**: All flashcards MUST have `exampleSentencesGenerated` field with proper `~word~` markup - no fallback UI exists

## 🚫 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE: NO FALLBACK UI
**NEVER create fallback UI to paper over missing data or broken functionality!**

- **Always fix the root cause** instead of adding bandaid solutions
- **If data is missing, throw a clear error** instead of showing wrong format
- **No "basic" flashcard formats** - only the proper cloze deletion format
- **If the backend doesn't generate proper data, fix the backend** - don't work around it in frontend
- **Better to crash with a clear error** than to lie to the user with wrong functionality

This prevents technical debt and ensures we actually solve problems instead of hiding them.

- **Smart Lookup**: Clickable words in transcriptions with instant definitions
- **Definition Sources**: Primary dictionary JSON, fallback to AI generation

### 3. Spaced Repetition System (SRS)
- **Algorithm**: Customized SRS with 9 interval levels
- **Card Types**: New cards, learning cards, review cards
- **Frequency-Based Sorting**: New cards sorted by word frequency (10 = most common)
- **Due Date Management**: Automatic scheduling based on performance
- **Session Limits**: Configurable daily new card limits

### 4. Flashcard System (Cloze Deletion Format)
- **Card Front**: English sentence with target word blanked out (e.g., "I will _____ into battle") + full translation with target word highlighted in native language
- **Card Back**: Full English sentence with target word highlighted in yellow + text-to-speech audio
- **Generated Content**: Each word gets 5 example sentences from Gemini API with ~word~ markup
- **Rotation System**: SRS interval determines which of the 5 sentences is shown
- **Touch Gestures** (Mobile): Swipe left (wrong), swipe right (correct), tap to flip
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded responses, smooth animations
- **Audio Integration**: Text-to-speech playback for pronunciation practice
- **Progress Tracking**: Session statistics and learning analytics

### 5. Profile Management
- **Multiple Profiles**: Cat, Dog, Mouse, Horse, Lizard + Non-saving mode
- **Data Persistence**: Individual progress tracking per profile
- **Cloud Sync**: Automatic backup of flashcard progress
- **Non-saving Mode**: Temporary sessions with hardcoded cards for testing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Redis server
- PostgreSQL database
- API keys: OpenAI, DeepL, Google Gemini

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd polycast-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd polycast-backend
npm install

# Create .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
DEEPL_API_KEY=your_deepl_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url

npm start
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Desktop Mode

## 🔄 SRS Algorithm Details

### Card States
- **New**: Never studied (frequency-sorted, 10 = highest priority)
- **Learning**: Short intervals (1-10 minutes)
- **Review**: Long intervals (days to months)

### Intervals
- Level 1: 1 minute
- Level 2: 5 minutes
- Level 3: 20 minutes
- Level 4: 1 hour
